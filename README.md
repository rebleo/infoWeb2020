#### Fordham University
#### CISC-2350-R01 || Online 
#### Monday + Thursday, 5:30 - 6:45pm EST 

	Professor: Rebecca Leopold
	Email: RLeopold [at] fordham.edu
	Course Wiki: https://github.com/rebleo/infoWeb2020/wiki

#### Course Description:
This 15-week course introduces students to the basics of design and programming for the web. Students will work primarily with HTML and CSS to build the structural and visual components of a website, using CSS to integrate interaction and animation. In the second half of the semester, students will be introduced to other libraries for responsive design (Bootstrap) and languages (EcmaScript) to create more complex, interactive and contemporary websites.

#### Learning Outcomes:
1. Become conversant in web authoring technologies including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
2. Create a unique media rich website considering key aspects of visual systems, interaction design
and user experience
3. Understand + implement an iterative process - including maintaining + adding to an existing site 
4. Learn how to proactively learn, using the web to research open source tools + documentation
5. Create an internal developer / creative community

---
#### Virtual Meetings:
We will hold two virtual class meetings weekly through the web conferencing tool Zoom. These meetings are the primary activity of the course, and will involve presentations, pair programming, group work and discussion. Attendance is mandatory and cameras should be on whenever possible especially when your classmates are presenting their work. Some class time will be used for one-on-one meetings or code studio. After we get started, student input regarding course structure is welcomed during this strange semester.

#### Method of Evaluation:
1. Class Participation (20% of grade): Students are expected to contribute positively to discussions and group work having thoughtfully completed the reading, technical and creative assignments.
2. Design + Technical Exercises (30% of grade)
3. Midterm Project (25% of grade)
4. Final Project (25% of grade)
  
Projects will be evaluated by three components equally: creativity, technical breadth, professional presentation as well as participation in user feedback and critique. Completed projects will be presented to the class and should reflect an iterative process, acknowledgment of user feedback.


---
#### Attendance:
This class meets for 1 hour and 15 minutes twice per week over Zoom. Students are expected to come on time. Students who come in later than 20 minutes after the class started will be marked absent. If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend a class, email me beforehand.
  * 3 unexcused latenesses = one absence.
  * 3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-). 
  * More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade.

#### Research + Resources (or the class repo):
All materials for this class are open source + can be accessed via the web. Regular updates to the class repo will contain starter code gone over during class as well as links to further technical reading (or watching). There will likely be more resources than you could possibly research + implement each week. The idea is to point students to a wide array of resources with an emphasis on the most modern + concise online documentation. Pick and choose what is of most interest to you - the repo is a jumping off point for your own research. Later in the semester students will be responsible for citing + discussing their research methods and discoveries with the class.

#### “Share” (or the class wiki):
The class wiki - is where the rest of the syllabus including in-class and homework assignments will be found. To turn in your homework you should add a link to your work weekly using Markdown. You are required to post on the wiki. To contribute to the wiki you must set up a Github account.
